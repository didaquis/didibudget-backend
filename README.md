# üí∞ didibudget-backend

This is an app to manage your money.
The proyect is splitted on two repositories: one for the backend and one for the frontend application. 

This repository is for the backend and is intended to work with [the frontend](https://github.com/didaquis/didibudget-frontend)

### üìù Backend Requirements
* MongoDB 4.0 or higher service running
* Node.js 10 or higher

### üìö How to run the application?
* Use the command: `npm install`. If you are deploying the app in production, it's better to use this command: `npm install --production`
* Configure the application:
  * Duplicate the configuration file `_env` and rename it as `.env`
  * Edit the file `.env`
* Then use: `npm run start`. 
* That's it! That was fast enough, right? üöÄ

**Do you need help with `.env` file?** 

Don't worry, I have written down some information for you. Here you have a guide:

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| PORT | The port for running the backend |
| ENVIROMENT | The mode of execution of Node.js. Choose between: production or development |
| LIMIT_USERS_REGISTERED | Maximum number of users allowed to register. Set the value to 0 to not use the limit |
| MONGO_FORMAT_CONNECTION | The format of connection with MongoDB service. Choose between: standard or DNSseedlist |
| MONGO_HOST | Set this value only if you are using the standard connection format. Host of MongoDB service |
| MONGO_PORT | Set this value only if you are using the standard connection format. Port of MongoDB service |
| MONGO_DB | Set this value only if you are using the standard connection format. The name of database |
| MONGO_USER | Set this value only if you are using the standard connection format. User name |
| MONGO_PASS | Set this value only if you are using the standard connection format. User password |
| MONGO_DNS_SEEDLIST_CONNECTION | Set this value only if you are using the DNSseedlist connection format. It should be something like this: mongodb+srv://user:password@uri-and-options |
| SECRET | JWT secret key. Remember not to share this key for security reasons |
| DURATION | JWT duration of auth token |

**How can I configure a user to be an administrator?** 

To make a user an administrator you must access to the database and search its registry. You will see a Boolean who allows the user to have the role of the administrator. Set it to 'true' and in his next authentication that user will have administrator permissions.

### üíª Tricks for development
* Run app in dev mode: `npm run dev`
* Run the linter: `npm run lint`
* Delete all log files: `npm run purge`
* Run the test, mode watch: `npm run test:watch`
